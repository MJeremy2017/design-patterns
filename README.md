# Design Patterns

>  A Pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.

## Refactoring time is Patterns time!
Refactoring is the process of making changes to your code to improve the way it is organized. 
The goal is to improve its structure, not change its behavior. 
This is a great time to reexamine your design to see if it might be better structured with patterns

## If you don’t need it now, don’t do it now.

If you have a practical need to support change in
a design today, go ahead and employ a pattern to handle that change. 
However, if the reason is only hypothetical, don’t add the pattern, it is only going to add 
complexity to your system, and you might never need it!
