# Factory Pattern

>  The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object,

> Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

A factory method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass.
This decouples the client code in the superclass from the object creation code in the subclass.
