# Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Our goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behavior without 
modifying existing code.
